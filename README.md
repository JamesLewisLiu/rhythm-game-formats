# Rhythm Game Formats

Ever wondered what makes your favorite rhythm game series tick? Now you know.
This repository contains information about file formats used by the Bemani
games we all know and love.

## Contributions

Your help to fill in what's missing would be greatly appreciated! If you have
information that can fill in the blanks or correct something that's already
included in this repo, feel free to fork it and send a pull request.

PRs will be verified by SaxxonPike before merge to ensure the quality of the
repo.

## What not to contribute

Currently, file formats that don't pertain to the Bemani series of rhythm games
or other related rhythm games (such as Pump It Up and In The Groove) will not
be accepted. Exceptions MAY be made for simulator formats such as Stepmania
and Be-Music Source; however, these formats are already quite well documented
and will probably clutter up the repo.

Contributions that are not for a Bemani rhythm game but do have significance
within the rhythm game community will be considered.
